# Goodreads Review Summarizer

## Overview

Goodreads Review Summarizer is a tool to collect and summarize book reviews from Goodreads. The goal of this project is to extract insights from multiple user reviews, providing a informative summary of a book's reception.

## Features

- Scrapes and summarizes book reviews from Goodreads
- Output the structured summaries by LLM to help users make informed reading choices
- Clustering and Visualize the reviews per rating. See [Clustering](#clustering).
- Support running LLMs locally or calling online APIs.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python3 installed. This project was developed using Python 3.10.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `playwright install` for installing playwright dependencies.
4. Choose one of [Supported APIs](#supported-apis) you prefer.

## Supported APIs

### Ollama
1. Install and run [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), and make sure it keeps running in the background.
2. Run `ollama pull qwen3:0.6b`
3. (Optional) To use clustering:
    - download [Qwen3-Embedding](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-GGUF/resolve/main/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-Q8_0.gguf?download=true) save in `./models`. 
    - In `./models`, run `ollama create qwen3_embed:0.6b -f Modelfile`

### OpenAI-Compatible
You can configure the settings for any OpenAI API-compatible service. 
For example, see `configs/clients/openai.yaml`, which uses OpenAI API to connect Ollama.

You can use dotenv to manage environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the projectâ€™s root directory and add your API key, for example: `OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"`. The program will load these settings.

## Usage

1. Browse the Goodreads page of the book you're interested in and note its identifier.

    For example, the Goodreads page for *Atomic Habits* is:
    https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits

    In this case, `40121378-atomic-habits` is the identifier you need.

2. Copy and paste the book identifier into a text file. This tool supports multiple books, so you can enter multiple identifiers, each on a new line.

    Refer to `books.txt` for an example.

3. Adjust `configs/main.yaml`. For more detail, please read the comments in the configurations.

4. Execute `python main.py`.
5. The results will be saved in the `output/` by default.

## Clustering
- Enable clustering by setting `clustering: true` in `configs/main.yaml`.
- Reviews are processed by generating text embeddings, reducing their dimensions with PCA, and clustering them using HDBSCAN.
- For each cluster, the program generates a summary, followed by an overall summary across all clusters. 
- Reviews without cluster labels are grouped and summarized separately.
- Enable visualizing by setting `viz_clusters: true` in `configs/main.yaml`. It uses UMAP for visualization.

## Notices

- Obtaining Goodreads reviews is not through an officially public API. Please be mindful of the frequency of requests and the amount of data being retrieved.
- Summary is generated by LLM, please verify the generated content

## Planned Features

- [ ] Frontend design
- [ ] Backend service
- [x] Improve summary method
- [x] Support other model API
- [x] Change to asynchronous requests to improve speed
